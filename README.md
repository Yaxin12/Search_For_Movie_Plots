Homework 3 

Kristen Zhang; Yaxin Zhao
# Scenario:
We are a historian specializing in early 20th-century cinema, working with a
database of films from the 1920s. This collection includes a vast array of silent films,
early talkies, and other cinematic works that includes plot descriptions. Our task is to
help users, who are scholars, students, and enthusiasts of vintage cinema, navigate this
extensive archive to find the specific films they are interested in. 

Our challenge is to develop a search tool that facilitates an efficient exploration of this rich historical movie database, enhancing users' understanding and appreciation of 1920s cinema.
# Our Task:
Our goal is to develop a prototype (POC/MVP) for a search tool that helps users
discover relevant movies and shows based on their queries. Our goal isnâ€™t to develop a
model ready for production, but develop a possible prototype and make a
recommendation to Our boss for what direction to move towards a production tool.
